                            The MAIA team, which stands for Mobility Applied in Artificial Intelligence, has as its primary
                            mission to provide a valuable opportunity for students who want to improve their skills and knowledge
                            in artificial intelligence and apply them to practical projects.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our team is dedicated to creating a learning and collaborative environment where students
                            interested in robotics and AI can not only expand their theoretical knowledge, but also put
                            it into practice by carrying out concrete projects. We believe that practical application 
                            plays a key role in developing solid AI and engineering skills.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We offer challenges where participants can get involved in projects that address real-world
                            challenges, allowing them to apply AI algorithms, data analysis and machine learning techniques 
                            to everyday situations. This not only enriches the learning experience, but also prepares our 
                            members to face the challenges of industry and AI research with confidence.
